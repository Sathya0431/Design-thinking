Problem definition is a crucial first step in the design thinking process. It involves clearly understanding and articulating the problem you want to solve. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Understand the Context**: Begin by gathering information about the situation or challenge. This may involve research, observations, and conversations with stakeholders.

2. **Identify Stakeholders**: Determine who is affected by the problem and who your solution will impact. Consider the perspectives of different stakeholders, including end-users, customers, employees, and any other relevant parties.

3. **Define the Problem**: Summarize the problem in a clear and concise manner. A well-defined problem statement should be specific, actionable, and focused on the user's needs or pain points. Avoid making assumptions at this stage.

4. **Frame the Challenge**: Consider reframing the problem as a "How might we..." statement. This encourages a more open and creative approach to finding solutions. For example, "How might we improve access to healthcare in rural areas?"

Once you've defined the problem, you can move on to the design thinking process, which typically consists of empathizing, ideating, prototyping, testing, and implementing, as mentioned in the previous response. This iterative approach helps you develop innovative and user-centric solutions to the well-defined problem.
